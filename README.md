Hi! I'm Chloe. :)
Thanks for stopping by.

I am an aspiring Engineer, certified in AWS as a Cloud Practioner, and in Containerized Applications.

Other certifications include Meta's certifications in Python programming, SQL databases, and version control with Git/GitHub.
If you take a look around my repositories, you'll see some of the work I've done with AWS/EKS and a few of the Meta labs.

There's also a basic website I created for a friend of mine who is an advocate for ethical adoption, which opened my eyes to how 
code and technology can make a real-world impact, and set me on a mission to create impactful things with code for a living. 

You'll also see a few that are empty. As I go about this coding and technology journey, you'll see them fill up with knowledge about Rust,
GoLang, JavaScript, and a 100 Days of Code challenge. 

If I'm not coding, I'm outside with my dogs, at the farmer's market, biking, and generally enjoying some sunshine. If there's snow
on the ground, I'll be inside writing poetry with my cat. 

TLDR; AWS, EKS, SQL, Python, GoLang, JavaScript, impactful work, sunshine, animals, music.
