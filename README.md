Hi! I'm Chloe. :)

I work at a cloud MSP called Sela right now and I'm doing work with "big 3" cloud consumers, and I personally specialize in AWS. I'm certified by AWS in containerized apps and love working with EKS! 
One piece of my studies currently is for the CKA exam. :) 

Outside of AWS-related work, my favorite coding language is Python. I'm certified by Meta as a Python Programmer and I'm currently learning how to do pen-testing with it along with Kali Linux. 
I'm also personally very interested in Rust, so I'm picking that up as my second programming language, although I've dabbled with JS, Ruby on Rails, and C too. 

Generative AI is the last thing (for now) on my roster for mastering new technical concepts - I never get tired of learning new things and seeing them work in the real world. 

Outside of my tech bubble, almost all of my hobbies are outdoors. From a small walk to my house to a coffee shop, hikes at local forest preserves, tennis courts, running around with my dogs, going to local farmer's markets, I will take any excuse to get some sunshine and fresh air.
