Hi! I'm Chloe. :)

I work at a cloud MSP called Sela right now and I'm doing work with "big 3" cloud consumers, and I personally specialize in AWS. I'm certified by AWS as a Cloud Practitioner and containerized apps, working on Solutions Architect, and love working with EKS! 

Outside of AWS-related work, my favorite coding language is Python. I'm certified by Meta as a Python Programmer and I'm currently learning how to do pen-testing with it along with Kali Linux. 

Full-stack JavaScript is the last thing (for now) on my roster for mastering new technical concepts - I never get tired of learning new things and seeing them work in the real world. 

Outside of my tech bubble, almost all of my hobbies are outdoors. From a small walk to my house to a coffee shop, hikes at local forest preserves, tennis courts, running around with my dogs, going to local farmer's markets, I will take any excuse to get some sunshine and fresh air.
